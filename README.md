# These are my dotfiles, this is where I dot my files.

This follows Holman's modular approach and using file extensions to classify
what should be done with the file.

## Usage

- Clone to ~/.dotfiles or similar.
- Run .dotfiles/script/bootstrap to make symlinks
- Run .dofiles/script/install to install stuff

## Plan

I would really like to get a system setup scripted in here.

Modularise bash_profile.

Set up whole osx environment.

Also should be able to use parts for some bash environment I'm ssh'd into.
